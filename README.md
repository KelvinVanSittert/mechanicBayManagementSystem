# Mechanic Bay Management System
The Mechanic Bay Management System is a project designed to smoothline the process of storing, moving and analysing vehicles. 
It has a easy to use gui that will show you what type of vehicles are booked, what bay they are booked in, the tools needed to fix the vehicle
and what type of mechanic will have the skills to fix the vehicle.
Each vehicle is tied to a specific bay, either repair, inspection, or mechanic.
Each vehicle is also tied to a vehicle type and who their owner is, as well as if it is a loyal customer or a normal customer.
The system lists all the employees and different types of employees in the company to help keep track of who is doing what and who is in charge of what.
